2. **Copy the Embed Code**: Once your course is created, navigate to the course page. Click on the "Share" button in the top right corner to access the embed code. Copy the provided code.
  - Alternatively, you can access the embed code from your project's courses page. Click the "More" button on each course, then click the "Embed" button to copy the code.



3. **Paste the Embed Code**: Now, go to the page on your site where you want to embed the course. Paste the embed code into the HTML of your site.

4. **View Your Embedded Course**: Save your changes and view your site. Your LectureKit course should now be embedded and ready for users to access directly from your site.
