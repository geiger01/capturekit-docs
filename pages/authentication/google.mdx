# Authentication

To interact with our API, you'll authenticate requests using the `x-api-key` header. Manage your API key securely in your project API Keys page.

Your API key grants significant privileges, so it's crucial to keep it confidential. Avoid sharing your API key in public repositories, client-side code, or any publicly accessible areas.

## Usage

To make API requests, include your API key in the `x-api-key` header of your HTTP requests. Here are examples for both Node.js and cURL:

### Node.js Example (with Axios)

```js copy
const axios = require('axios');

async function getData() {
    const response = await axios.get('https://www.lecturekit.io/api/v1/courses', {
        headers: {
            'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
        }
    });

    return response.data;
}

getData();
```

### cURL Example
```curl copy
curl https://www.lecturekit.io/api/v1/courses \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Important Security Reminders

- **Security First:** Your API key is sensitive information, treat it as such.
- **Authentication is Mandatory:** API requests without authentication will fail.

Remember, your API key is your access pass, so guard it wisely!
