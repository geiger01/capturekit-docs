# Authentication Overview

NextUpKit provides easy-to-integrate authentication options to secure and streamline user access. You can quickly set up passwordless login and third-party logins to enhance the user experience.

- Authentication is made using [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org)

## Update your `.env.local` file:

```bash copy
 NEXTAUTH_SECRET=
 NEXTAUTH_URL=     http://localhost:3000
```
    - Make sure to generate a key for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, you can use [This Key Generator](https://generate.plus/en/base64) to generate a strong key.
