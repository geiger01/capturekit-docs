# Setting Up Resend

Follow these steps to configure Resend as your email provider for sending transactional emails and allowing magic login links.

## Setup

1. Go to the [Resend website](https://resend.com) and create an account.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the **API Keys** section.
3. Create a new API key and copy it. You'll need this key in the next step.
4. In your projectâ€™s `.env.local` file, add the following environment variable and paste the value:
   - `RESEND_API_KEY=   your-resend-api-key`

## Sending Transactional Emails

To send emails, you'll use the helper function `sendEmail` from the `lib/email.ts` file.

### Helper Function: `lib/email.ts`

```ts
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { FROM_EMAIL } from './consts';

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY);

export const sendEmail = async (
  to: string | string[],
  subject: string,
  html: string,
  from?: string
) => {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: from || FROM_EMAIL,
    to,
    subject,
    html,
  });
};
