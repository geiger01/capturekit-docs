# Getting Started

Welcome to CaptureKit! This guide will walk you through setting up and making your first API request. In just a few minutes, you'll be able to capture screenshots, extract structured content, and analyze webpages using our API.

## 1. Get Your Access Key ðŸ”‘

To start using CaptureKit, you'll need an Access Token. Follow these steps:

1. **Sign up** at [CaptureKit Dashboard](https://capturekit.dev/login)
2. **Copy your Access Key** from the project `Access Keys` tab.

You can attach your access key to requests in any of these ways:

- `GET` parameter: `access_key`
- `POST` parameter: `access_key`
- `Header`: `x-access-key`

## 2. Make Your First API Request
